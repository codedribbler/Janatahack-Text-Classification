As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process.\n\nGiven the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set.\n\nNote that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics:\n\n1. Computer Science\n\n2. Physics\n\n3. Mathematics\n\n4. Statistics\n\n5. Quantitative Biology\n\n6.

data , inference can \n  be made at two levels : global , i.e. xxunk condition presence for the \n  subject , and local , i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual \n  measurement extracted from the subject 's data . xxmaj while global inference is widely \n  used , local inference , which can be used to form subject - specific effect maps , \n  is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of \n  dispersed isolated islands . xxmaj in this article , we propose a reconstruction \n  method , named xxup rsm , to improve subject - specific detections of predictive \n  modeling approaches and in particular , binary classifiers . xxup rsm specifically \n  aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite \n  sample of examples to train classifiers . xxmaj the proposed method is a wrapper - type \n  algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic \n  manner , i.e. without information on condition presence . xxmaj reconstruction is posed \n  as a xxmaj maximum - a - xxmaj posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are \n  estimated from training data in a classifier - specific fashion . xxmaj experimental \n  evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the \n  xxmaj alzheimer 's xxmaj disease xxmaj neuroimaging xxmaj initiative ( xxup adni )

kernels for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated \n  balls . xxmaj we find the representation of xxmaj poisson kernels and zonal polyharmonics in \n  terms of the xxmaj gegenbauer

variance over a domain . xxmaj to correct this problem , xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk \n  ( 2015 ) proposed a variance - stabilizing ( xxup vs ) local variable bandwidth for xxmaj local \n  xxmaj linear ( xxup ll ) regression estimator . xxmaj in contrast , xxmaj choi and xxmaj hall ( 1998 ) proposed \n  the xxunk ( xxup sk ) methods for a univariate xxup ll estimator and constructed a convex \n  combination of one xxup ll estimator and two xxup sk estimators that are symmetrically \n  placed on both sides of the xxup ll estimator ( the convex combination ( xxup cc ) \n  estimator ) to

posts in the same time \n  period on a variety of topics around the 2016 elections . xxmaj we use label \n  propagation to infer the users ' ideology based on the news sources they share . \n  xxmaj we are able to classify a large number of users as liberal or conservative with \n  precision and recall above 84 % . xxmaj conservative users who retweet xxmaj russian trolls \n  produced significantly more tweets than liberal ones , about 8 times as many in \n  terms of tweets . xxmaj additionally , trolls ' position in the retweet network is \n  stable over time , unlike users who

the same bit error rate . \n  xxmaj hence , multiple studies have proposed doing xxup amsdu aggregation adaptively based \n  on the error rate . xxmaj this study evaluates if there is a \\ xxunk } \n  advantage in doing adaptive xxup amsdu aggregation based on the link bit error rate . \n  xxmaj evaluations on a model show that instead of implementing a complex adaptive \n  xxup amsdu frame aggregation mechanism which impact queuing and other implementation \n  aspects , it is easier to influence packet error rate with traditional \n  mechanisms while keeping the xxup amsdu aggregation logic simple . \n ,xxbos xxmaj milky xxmaj way open clusters are very diverse in terms of age , chemical \n  composition , and kinematic properties . xxmaj intermediate - age and old open clusters \n  are less common , and it is even harder to find them inside the solar \n  xxmaj galactocentric radius , due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction \n  inside this region . xxup ngc 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters ( iocs ) \n  observed by the $ xxunk survey ( xxup ges ) . xxmaj this cluster is an important target \n  for calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and \n  chemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters . xxmaj using the measurements \n  from $ xxunk internal data release 4 ( idr4 ) , we identify 95 main - sequence \n  dwarfs as cluster members from the xxup xxunk target list , and eight giants as \n  cluster members from the xxup uves target list . xxmaj the dwarf cluster members have a \n  median radial velocity of $ 13.6 \\ xxunk $ km s$^{-1}$ , while the giant cluster \n  members have a median radial velocity of $ 12.0 \\ xxunk $ km s$^{-1}$ and a median \n  [ xxmaj fe / h ] of $ 0.10 \\ pm0.02 $ dex . xxmaj the color - magnitude diagram of these cluster \n  members suggests an age of $ 0.9 \\ pm0.1 $ xxmaj gyr , with $ ( m - xxup xxunk $ and \n  $ xxup e(b - xxup xxunk xxmaj we perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of xxup ngc \n  6802 , including 27 elemental species . xxmaj to gain a more general picture about \n  iocs , the measurements of xxup ngc 6802 are compared with those of other iocs \n  previously studied by xxup ges , that is , xxup ngc xxunk , xxmaj xxunk 20 , xxup ngc xxunk , and \n  xxmaj berkeley 81 . xxup ngc 6802 shows similar c , n , xxmaj na , and xxmaj al abundances as other iocs . \n  xxmaj these elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of \n  cluster turn - off mass . xxmaj the $ \\ alpha$ , iron - peak , and neutron - capture elements \n  are also explored in a self - consistent way . \n ,xxbos xxmaj proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task . \n  xxmaj one of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is \n  increasing , which means that the security level of every single atomic message \n  exchanged in the protocol , safely evaluated , never xxunk . xxmaj recently , two \n  families of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of \n  atomic messages . xxmaj the first one is the family of interpretation - functions . xxmaj the \n  second is the family of witness - functions . xxmaj in this paper , we show that the \n  witness - functions are more efficient than interpretation - functions . xxmaj we give a \n  detailed analysis of an ad - hoc protocol on which the witness - functions succeed \n  in proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation - functions fail \n  to do so . \n \ny: EmptyLabelList\n,,,,\nPath:
